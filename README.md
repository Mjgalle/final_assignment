# Project Proposal: {{MEMORY GAME}}

## Project Goals
Have a fully functioning memory game. Was able to deploy it using Heroku.


## Tech Stack

### First Party Tools
- Going to be working with React and Node. React is going to handle the interface and node is going to be used to communicate with the data in the React application. 

### Third Party Tools
- The information that will be displayed on each 'card' are images used from all the students form this cohort. Including the teachers and our great T.A. U
- Use bootstrap for CSS. Some third party styling tools all documented and sourced where they are being used. 

## Features and Deliverables
What I will be delivering for my Final Project is a fully functioning Memory Game. 

## Data
 - The images were created in Adobe Illustrator using screenshots. 
 - Users can only click up to 2 cards, once they click on the two cards a timer function starts which gives the user a second to look at the content on each of the cards. If the content makes a 'match' the card will stay facing up. If not the cards will go back to not facing the user.  
 - Once all the cards have been matched they will get a prompt saying congratulations on their win. 


## SETUP
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Run: npm start
