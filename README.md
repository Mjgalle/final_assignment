# Project Proposal: {{MEMORY GAME}}

## Project Goals
Have a fully functioning memory game. Implementing some timing functions. Get
to really work with changing state, when it changes, how to change it, the best way to change it. Want to improve my skills with React. 

## Tech Stack

### First Party Tools
- Going to be working with React and Node. React is going to handle the interface and node is going to be used to communicate with the data in the React application. 

### Third Party Tools
The information that will be displayed on each 'card' will come from Brainstation's own page. It will implement words, concepts, programs we learned during this 10 week learning period. 

## Features and Deliverables
What I will be delivering for my Final Project is a fully functioning Memory Game. If I get the game working before the deadline, I would like to implement maybe a music player. List of Highscores. Instructions. More information about the actual information being displayed on each card. Maybe even get a log in page if I have the time. 

## Data
 - The Data is going to come from the brainstation page on each chapter we have covered. 
 - It will work when the user clicks on a 'card', the information 'stored' inside the 'card' will appear. Once the user clicks on the second card, a timer will start, and once that time is over, both the cards are going to go back to their original state if the cards dont match. 
 - If the cards do match, the user will get a prompt congratulating them on the match and they will be able to keep playing the game. 
 - The cards will stay showing the content, and not be able to get clicked on again. 
 - Once all the cards have been matched they will get a prompt saying congratulations on their win.
